## Introduction ℹ️

Competitive programming often demands efficient and optimized data structures to solve complex problems within tight constraints. This repository aims to provide Python implementations of such data structures along with explanations and examples to help you understand and utilize them effectively in competitive programming scenarios.

## Data Structures Included 📦

At present, the following data structures are included:
- [ ] Segment Tree
- [ ] Fenwick Tree (Binary Indexed Tree)
- [ ] Trie
- [ ] Disjoint Set (Union Find)
- [ ] AVL Tree
- [ ] Suffix Array
- [ ] Persistent Data Structures

Stay tuned! More data structures will be added soon to help you tackle a wide range of problems efficiently. 🚀

## Usage 🛠️

Each data structure is implemented in its own module for easy integration into your projects. You can clone this repository and import the desired data structure directly into your Python code.

Example:
```python
from segment_tree import SegmentTree

# Your code here using the SegmentTree
